## How to Connect to the KS Docker Machines

This guide explains how to connect to your assigned server machine via SSH.

## Credentials

- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** `ks2025@`

## Server Address Format

To connect to a specific machine, use the following format:

```bash
ssh root@chinczyk.cloud -p 25XX
```

Replace `XX` with the number of your assigned machine. For example:

- For **Machine 01**:
  ```bash
  ssh root@chinczyk.cloud -p 2501
  ```

- For **Machine 25**:
  ```bash
  ssh root@chinczyk.cloud -p 2525
  ```

## Example Connection

```bash
ssh root@chinczyk.cloud -p 2503
```

When prompted, enter the password: `ks2025@`

## Notes

- Make sure port **25XX** is open and not blocked by your local firewall.
- If you see a warning about authenticity of the host, type `yes` to continue.
- After login, you‚Äôll be in a Linux environment. Start with `ls`, `pwd`, or check your assigned tasks!
